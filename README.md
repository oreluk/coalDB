# coalDB

coalDB is a stand-alone MATLAB based application to the CCMSC Coal Database.

## Motivation

This application acts as a front-end to the cloud-database hosted by [PrIMe](http://primekinetics.org). The CCMSC Coal Database is a crowd-sourced database composed of coal experiments from the literature. This application provides ease of access to the CCMSC Coal Database by allowing users to discover, visualize and extract data on coal data.

## Requirements

**[ReactionLab](https://github.com/PrIMeKinetics/ReactionLab)** toolbox is required. 

## Future Changes

* Add Introduction to submission -- Add more documentation to the tutorials, to make contributions and uploading coal data as easy as possible
